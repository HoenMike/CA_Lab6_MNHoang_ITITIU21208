# Array Printer in Assembly

This simple Assembly program was written by `Mai Nguyen Hoang - ITITIU21208`. The program prints the elements of an array using recursion.

## Program Description

The program contains an array of integers from 0 to 10. The main function loads the address of the array and calls the `print_arr` function.

The `print_arr` function prints the elements of the array one by one. It uses recursion to traverse the array. The recursion stops when the end of the array is reached.

Each integer is printed followed by a space. After all elements are printed, the program exits.

## How to Run

To run this program, you need an Assembly language simulator like QtSpim. Load the `.s` file into the simulator and run it.
